# This Python Basics Repo
Covers some of the Python Language Basics covered at the elementary level for MATLAB. 
The code and examples are solely for purposes of experimentation.
Higlighted are some of the errors and mistakes elementary level Python programmers make(myself included).
I hope i am corrected where mistakes are made  and also collaborate, and learn more .

 - Basic Commands & Syntax 
 - Input, Output and Operators on Variables and types(Relational and logical operators)
 - Array , Linear & Matrix Operations.
 - Lists Tuples Dictionaries.
 - Basic Commands in MATLAB
 - Flow Control Statements in MATLAB(if_else while, for 
 - Math Functions(Trigonometric, Exponential, Complex, Rounding and remainder, Specialized math functions,Number theoretic functions, Coordinate transforms
